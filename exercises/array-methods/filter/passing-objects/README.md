# Passing Objects

Write a function which keeps only passing objects

- ARGS: an array of objects, most will have a `pass` property:
  - `{pass: true}`
  - The `pass` property can have any type!
  - ... but not all objects have a `pass` property! if an entry does not have a `pass` property, you still want to keep it
- RETURN: an empty array, or an array containing only passing object
  - passing objects look like this: `{ pass: true }`
